"""
Given n points on a 2D plane, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

Sample Input :

(1, 1)
(2, 2)
Sample Output :

2
You will be given 2 arrays X and Y. Each point is represented by (X[i], Y[i])

            1. We don't need to check of intercept as we kept one end fixed.
